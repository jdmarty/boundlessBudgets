## Description
This application uses a combination of MongoDB and IndexedDB to maintain a budget tracking system that graphically displays expenses and income. The two database system allows the application to be used even without access to the internet, as transactions are stored in the indexedDB when the app is offline and sent to the online database once a connection is established

## How To Use
- To add a transaction, enter a name and a positive dollar amount in the form at the top of the home page.
- Click "Add Fund" or "Subtract Funds" to update the budget database with a new income or expense.
- Click "Clear Transactions" to permanently empty the transactions database and start with a fresh budget graph.
